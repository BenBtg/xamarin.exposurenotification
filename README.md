Apple and Google are both creating APIâ€™s for a compatible BLE based Contact Tracing implementation which relies heavily on generating and storing rolling unique identifiers on a device, which are broadcast to nearby devices.  Devices which detect nearby identifiers then store these identifiers as they come into range (or contact) with for up to 14 days.

When a person has confirmed a diagnosis, they tell their device which then submits the locally stored, self-generated rolling unique identifiers from the last 14 days to a back end service provided by the app implementing the API.

Devices continually request the keys submitted by diagnosed people from the backend server.  The device then compares these keys to the unique identifiers of other devices it has been near in the last 14 days.


## Xamarin.ExposureNotification

This is a cross platform API wrapper around the native Android and iOS API's.

### Xamarin.ExposureNotification

This project contains the cross platform wrapper API.

Currently it also contains stubs for what we think each C# binding to the actual native API's will look like:

- `Xamarin.ExposureNotification/NativeApi.android.cs`
- `Xamarin.ExposureNotification/NativeApi.ios.cs`

## Sample

A sample Mobile app and Back end server to use the API.
